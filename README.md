# SIFT-Based-Feature-Detection-and-Matching-in-Rotated-Images
Implemented SIFT-based keypoint detection and matching between original and 45° rotated image pairs. Applied Lowe’s ratio test and visualized the top 5 matches to demonstrate rotation-invariant feature matching in image pairs using OpenCV.
